# The 30 best horror movies of all time

The best horror movies keep us on the edge of our seats. They’re unpredictable and terrifying, with no respect whatsoever for our boundaries or bedtimes. The best scary movies are the ones that don’t just make you jump when you are watching them – but clamber under the duvet with you when you retreat to sleep. And yet, still, we want to find the scariest, the most terrifying and the most disturbing horror films to fire digitally into our eyeballs. Even when the world outside is unpredictable we still hunger to settle down with a horror movie or six where we at least can watch destruction in a safe environment.
