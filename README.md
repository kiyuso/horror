# The 5 best horror movies of all time

The best horror movies keep us on the edge of our seats. They’re unpredictable and terrifying, with no respect whatsoever for our boundaries or bedtimes. The best scary movies are the ones that don’t just make you jump when you are watching them – but clamber under the duvet with you when you retreat to sleep. And yet, still, we want to find the scariest, the most terrifying and the most disturbing horror films to fire digitally into our eyeballs. Even when the world outside is unpredictable we still hunger to settle down with a horror movie or six where we at least can watch destruction in a safe environment.

## Host (2020)

The movie: We knew it was on the way, but post-pandemic horror has already arrived in the shape of a Zoom call gone very, very wrong. Desperately on the hunt for something to do other than endless lockdown quizzes – we feel this – a group of friends get together for an online mid-lockdown seance. What follows is a short, sharp shock of found footage adrenaline in an intimidatingly lean 56 minute run time. Host isn’t the first horror to take place on a computer screen, taking terrifying inspiration from REC, The Blair Witch Project, and Paranormal Activity, yet delivering a dangerously relevant frightmare. Happy spookies. 

### Saw (2004)
